# consensus-highlighter changelog

## 2022-07-26 edition

Version `3.0.a`

1. Add option `-l/min-feature-len`. It sets minimum length of an output feature.

2. Add option `-C/upper-coverage-coefficients`. It sets threshold(s) for annotating **high-coverage** regions. For example, to annotate regions with coverage > 1.7Ã—*M*, where *M* is median coverage, you should specify `-C 1.7`. You can specify multiple coefficients: `-C 1.5,1.7`, in the same way as for option `-c`.

3. Change long option name: `-c/coverage-thresholds` -> `-c/lower-coverage-thresholds`.

4. Options `-c` and `-C` can be disabled now: specify `-c off`, `-C off`, and low-coverage or high-coverage regions won't be annotated, respectively.

5. Add option `-k/--keep-temp-cov-file`. If it is specified, temporary file `coverages.tsv` won't be deleted after work of the program.

## 2022-04-26 edition

Version `2.3.a`

1. Add recommendation "samtools `1.13` or later is recommended". This is the version, in which `samtools depth` [had beed](https://github.com/samtools/samtools/releases/tag/1.13) completely rewritten. Since 1.13, `samtools depth` calculates coverage more accurately.

2. Now consensus-highlighter does not crash if samtools version is of the following format: `1.15.1` (three dot-separated numbers). Previously, only two dot-separated numbers were permitted.

## 2022-02-23 edition

Version `2.2.b`

Changes:
1. Now consensus-highlighter removes its temporary file `coverages.tsv`, where coverage value of each base is stored.
2. A bug was fixed that would cause the program to write error message about an unmet dependency to stout instead of stderr.

## 2022-02-10 edition

Version `2.2.a`

Now consensus-highlighter adds a comment to output GenBank files. Here is the example of such a comment:

```
COMMENT     ##Coverage-Data-START##
            Minimum Coverage    :: 0
            Average Coverage    :: 147.54
            Median Coverage     :: 70
            Maximum Coverage    :: 2009
            Zero-coverage bases :: 278 bp
            ##Coverage-Data-END##
```

## 2022-01-24 edition

Version `2.1.a`

Now consensus-highlighter is compatible with samtools 1.13+.

## 2021-12-23 edition

Version `2.0.b`

Now consensus-highlighter calculates and prints average coverage.

## 2021-12-09 edition

Version `2.0.a`

Removed options `-o/--outdir` and `--prefix`.

Added option `-o/--outfile`. And now consensus-highlighter.py writes all GenBank output records to this single output GenBank file.

## 2021-06-15 edition

Version `1.1.a`

`consensus-highlighter` no more piles up coverage features with identical locations. It means that you will not see both "zero coverage" and "coverage < 10" features starting at the same positions and ending at the same positions.

## 2021-06-11 edition

Version `1.0.d`

Added warning messages for following cases:

1. If the program cannot find ids of sequence(s) from `-f` fasta file in the coverage file.
2. If length of sequence in `-f` fasta file is not equal to number of coverage positions reported by `samtools depth` and stored in the coverage file.

## 2021-06-10 edition

Version `1.0.b`

Fixed bug that would cause the program to stumble on a non-extant directory in PATH while checking dependencies.

And then...

Version `1.0.c`

Fixed bug that cause the program to stumble on lowercase input sequences.

## 2021-06-03 edition

Init release. Version `1.0.a`
